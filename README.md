# Stellar-Motion
MATLAB Project Assignment 

# Introduction 
In this project we have used MATLAB to find and observe the wavelength of the hydrogen alpha line of HD94028 and compared it to the known wavelength of the hydrogen absorption to determine how fast the star is moving away from the earth. with precise spectral measurements over time astronomers use this technique to discover the slight oscillation that demonstrate the  presence of planets

# Task
Determine a star's motion by calculating the redshift in its spectrum, using the Hydrogen-alpha (Ha) line.
Calculate the redshift factor using the formula

z = (lambdaHa/lambdaHaRef) - 1;

where the reference wavelength for Ha is lambdaHaRef=656.28 nm.

Calculate the rate that the star is moving away from the Earth (in km/s) using the formula

speed = z * c 

where  is the speed of light: c= 299792.458 km/s.

# Result
you have found the Hyrogen-alpha wavelength of the star by finding the minimum value of the spectral intensities (s).For some stars, the Hydrogen-alpha line occurs at the maximum intensity value, rather than the minimum. Therefore, a more robust approach is to find the maximum anomaly (difference from the mean), rather than the maximum or minimum spectral value.The anomaly is defined as the absolute value of the difference between s and mean(s).
